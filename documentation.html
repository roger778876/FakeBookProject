			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>
				One of the most widespread methods of communication is through social networks.
				When the user first visits the website, he/she will be greeted with a simple Login/Register page.
				Once the user creates an account, he/she will have the ability to converse and interact with the
				many other users in a friendly environment. They can share interests, ideas, and hobbies in the
				main page, where users can post, comment on other posts, as well as "liking/smiling" other posts. 
				Every user also has a personally generated profile page, where he/she can populate an "About Me" 
				section with "what's cool about them". 
			</p>

			<h1>Achievements</h1>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The user can first login or register. Python will either check for
						the validity of the username/password, or will append a new record to profiles.csv</li>
					<li>A navigation bar appears on top of each page, with links to "Home", "My Profile", "Settings",
						and "Logout"</li>
					<li>Main Page
						<ul>
							<li>The user can view the main page with posts/likes/comments that is generated from mainpage.csv
								by clicking "Home" in the navigation bar</li>
							<li>The user can create a new post, which when submitted will appear on the main page and
								will be added to mainpage.csv</li>
							<li>The user can comment on posts, which when submitted will appear under the post and will
								be added to mainpage.csv</li>
							<li>The user can like posts by clicking on the smile emoji under the post; the username will appear
								in the likes section under the post and will be added to mainpage.csv</li>
							<li>Each post/comment is accompanied with the time/date of submission</li>
							<li>Each post/comment has the submitter's username, which when clicked, will direct the user
								to the submitter's profile page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Profile Pages
						<ul>
							<li>Profile pages can be generated from profiles.csv for each user</li>
							<li>The profile page includes data such as username, first name, and an editable "About Me"</li>
							<li>The user can view his/her own profile page by clicking "My Profile" in the navigation bar</li>
							<li>The user can view other user's profile pages by clicking their usernames in posts/comments</li>
							<li>The user can edit only his/her own "About Me" section</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Settings Page
						<ul>
							<li>The user can view an account settings page by clicking "Settings" in the navigation bar</li>
							<li>The user can edit his/her first name and password</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Miscellaneous
						<ul>
							<li>The user is kept logged in, even when clicking to a different page. This is accomplished using
								a system of forms and hidden inputs. This does raise a security issue because the username/password
								is viewable in the HTML page source</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
				
			<h2>Features of note</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The user can only edit his/her own "About Me" section of their profile page. If the user is viewing another
						user's profile page, the edit form will be grayed out</li>
					<li>The user can go to other profile pages by clicking the username links (actually they are forms) in posts/comments</li>
					<li>The user can "smile" a post by clicking the smile emoji, which adds their username to the section. Clicking
						the smile emoji again will "un-smile" the post, removing the username from the section</li>
					<li>The mainpage.csv and profiles.csv uses various, unique ways of separating fields. Pipelines ("|") are
						used to separate the "main" fields, **!!** 's are used as newlines, and $%$% 's are used to separate fields
						in comments. These unique separators allow the user to submit newlines, commas, and almost any other character
						(though we have limited some of the user's freedom in submissions). You can view these CSV files at
						<i>/home/students/2018/cesar.mu/projectHiddenFiles</i></li>
					<li>The user is always kept logged in (except when clicking "Logout") through a system of forms and hidden inputs.
						Every link/button is actually a form with hidden inputs for username and password. When Python generates the page,
						it replaces each hidden input placeholder with the user's account info. (This introduces a security issue)</li>
					<li>The time/date that is added with every post/comment allows the posts/comments to be sorted in reverse order
						(newest shows first)</li>
					<li>When editing First name or password in the Settings page, a red message will show up when the user tries to include
						an "|" or "**!!**" in his/her new name/password</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Learning</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use of the "time" module, specifically the "strftime" function within that module. The use of "strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")"
						allows for the generation of time/date for each post/comment</li>
					<li>The .join() function allows a list to be converted into a string</li>
					<li>We learned CSS that allowed our pages to look more attractive. For example, the buttons change in appearance when hovered
						over!</li>
					<li>We learned about the importance of HTML templates and separate Python modules</li>
					<li>Use of the "textarea" input element as well as "required" and "disabled" attributes for various inputs</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h1>Next Steps, with time estimates</h1>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cut-off Time: Sunday 6/12/16 @ 8pm.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Future features:</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a messaging system, editing Python, HTML, and the profiles.csv files...1.5 hours</li>
					<li>Create a buddy system, editing Python, HTML, and the profiles.csv files...1.5 hours</li>
					<li>Create a profile picture upload system, editing Python, HTML, and the profiles.csv files...1 hour</li>
					<li>Patch the bug of usernames containing certain special characters (such as the pound sterling &#163...0.5 hours</li>
					<li>Find a new way of keeping the user logged in, without introducing the security issue of having the username/password
						in the HTML source</li>

			<h1>Bugs</h1>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>If the user reloads and confirms form resubmission after submitting a new post or comment, the post/comment will be
						submitted again, creating 2 identical submissions</li>
					<li>If the username associated with a comment is too long, it will be cut off in the link. This can be seen as being
						intentional, as the username/link won't overlap with the comment content.</li>
					<li>The use of certain characters as usernames/passwords/etc. will cause the user to be logged out whenever he/she visits
						a different page. One such character is the pound sterling ("&#163" or "& #163"). Credit goes to Austin Leung for finding this
						bug.</li>
				</ul>
